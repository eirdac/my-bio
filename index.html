		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="bio">Hi, I‚Äôm <strong class="highlight">Adrienne</strong>. I was born and raised in Canada. I have lived in Toronto since birth. When I was growing up, I wanted to be an author because I enjoyed reading and writing stories, but that slowly changed to more tech oriented careers as I grew up, such as a video gamer developer, graphic designer and finally, a UX designer. </p>

	<section id="Education">
		<h2 class="edu box">Educational Background</h2>
		<p>In terms of my educational background, I went to the University of Toronto right out of high school and got my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Cognitive Science and Bioethics. After a few months of job searching, I decided to go back to school. So I decided to attend George Brown College for its Interaction Design because the courses seemed to align with my interests and career goals. I also really liked that there was an option to do a field placement before graduating from the program.</p>
		
		<p>I've learned a few programming languages in the past, but have not forgotten them after not using them for a while.:</p>

		<p>The programming languages are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>HTML/CSS</li>
			</ul>
